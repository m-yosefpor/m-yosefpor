### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Mohammad, a cloud engineer at Snapp!

I'm really interested in:

Cloud:
- I love [CNCF projects](https://www.cncf.io/projects/) (**almost** all of them). I'm experienced and familiar with many of those projects.


Opensource and Golang:


- I've authored and have contributed to many repos on snapp-cab org [view](https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Asnappcloud+org%3Asnapp-incubator&type=Repositories)
- Also you can view some of my contributions to other notable OSS projects: [view](https://github.com/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Am-yosefpor+archived%3Afalse+-org%3Am-yosefpor+-org%3Asnapp-incubator)
